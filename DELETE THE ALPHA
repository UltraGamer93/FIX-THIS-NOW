YOU NEED TO DISCARD THE NEW ALPHA VERSION, IMMEDIATELY AND STOP IT FROM REACHING THE PUBLIC!!
THE MULTIPLAYER TEST HAS DESTROYED THE GAME!

I was testing it and some player came in and crashed my world! He was glitchy and was a shadow, and it was super weird.
We need to send the multiplayer back to the drawing board man, this version has completely fucked it, and we need to start borrowing previous build assets instead of
writing a new system each time.

Please, for the love of God, don't release this build.
What i will do is make a new world and pin-point certain things that will desperately need fixing.
